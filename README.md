# april-2020-covid-astroturfing-exploration
An afternoon's work looking at sketchy FB groups related to the Coronavirus pandemic.

This is source material for https://docs.google.com/document/d/1220uhJqzqJB4pFFkVXvNgRXDsB2w4a81cUnuQ2_RVzY/edit?usp=sharing. I am putting it up here to show my work and allow others to replicate my results if needed.

These records were captured because the activity seemed unusual. This repo's contents are intended for future analysis and tracking to see if the apparently related domains registered over this time period start to be used in a coordinated way.
